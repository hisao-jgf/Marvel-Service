# HisaoJGF's Marvel Information Portal

(This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))

### **In order to use the application, please register on the Marvel API website: https://developer.marvel.com**
\
**Please install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your local machine before following up with the steps below.**

---

### If you want to create new version, redesign or modify this application, please follow the guidelines:

1. Please, download or fork the source code to your PC / Account by pressing either:
    1. **"Fork"** button below the header of the GitHub page, which will automatically add the copy of current repository to your GitHub account, without affecting the original repository with changes you may add to the copy.  
    You may also find the **instructions** on how to connect your local machine repository with the remote one: [GitHub: Working with repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories),  
    and then pull the files from the latter: [GitHub: Getting changes](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository)  

    2. **"<> Code"** button above the repository source files, and then selecting **"Download ZIP"**, which will download the *'.zip'* archive with all of the required files to your **Downloads** folder. Then put the files into the designated folder.  

2.  Open the ***.env_example*** file, and change *"Your Marvel API key here.."* to the **public** key of your personal account, which you can find at: **https://developer.marvel.com/account**

3. Close and rename it to ***.env***

4. Type **npm install** into the terminal of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  ( you can open it by pressing Ctrl / Cmd + ` ) to install all of the dependencies packages required to run the application

5. You're ready to use the application by launching it ( type **npm start** in the terminal ) on your localhost domain! :)

*(Please make sure you do have __\*.__ characters typed into the **"Authorized referrers"** field, to ensure that API calls from your localhost domain are allowed.)*

**If something goes wrong**, *( an error appears in the terminal e.g. )* **please, follow up with searching for the solution in the internet.**  

*Since the list of possible errors on different operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux) could be reasonably long, there was no resolution provided to any error encountering.* 

### ***Please enjoy the project!***
